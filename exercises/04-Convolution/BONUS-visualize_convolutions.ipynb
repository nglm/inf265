    "Deep learning models are often criticized for being a black box. To assert this problem many visualization techniques have been developped in order to get a better understanding of how the model is learning and how to interpret its results. In this assignment we will go through some of these techniques, based on this week's module's video *[Lecture 12 | Visualizing and Understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wcs6szJWMY&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&index=15)* \n",
